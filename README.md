# Webdetect checksum solution: different Python parts
## [client](client) 
Contains scripts that represent client of part of Webdetect checksum solution.
Latest implementation is [here](client/webdetect_v2.py).

## [scanner](scanner)
Dumps repository with app-versions (i.e. WordPress, Joomla, WP plugins directories) to CSV with checksums.
Latest implementation is [here](scanner/scanner.py).

Also note that file path is also added to CSV by default (see `walk` method), which is not always required.

### Example
Expected to be run on avtest.corp.cloudlinux.com. 
Generates `whitelist.csv`, which has to be processed by webdetect_java repository.

```sh
python3 scanner.py /storage/repo > whitelist.csv
```

## [server](server)
Deprecated, webdetect_java repo transforms CSV generated by scanner to leveldb DB.
